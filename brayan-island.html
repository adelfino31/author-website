				<p>Sneak peek of Chapter 1:</p>
				<h3 class="book"> Chapter 1: Meredith</h3>
				<p class="firstp">As the ferry nears the Brayan Island shoreline, most of the passengers flock to the railings
				to watch my favorite place in the world come into view. With every second, more details of the 
				island appear, like I'm watching a work of art being painted in real time. It's beautiful, but
				something I'm so used to. I didn't realize how much I had been taking it for granted until I put
				some space between me and the island. Three years to be exact.</p>
				<p class="book">Brayan is beautiful to me in the way that you look at someone you love. You've seen them so 
				often that you grow accustomed to the way they look. And you forget to appreciate them sometimes.</p>
				<p class="book">My parents, Marie and Daniel Boone, bought a summer home on Brayan before they had kids. So
				my older sister, Clara, and I have spent every single summer here since we were, quite literally, 
				in the womb.
				Three years ago, at 20 years old, I spent the first summer of my life somewhere besides Brayan. I
				couldn't come back. It was too painful. Everything that happened here when I was 19...I just couldn't.
				Even when my sister, parents, cousins, and friends begged me to.</p>
				<p class="book">The year after that, the pain was still too raw from everything that happened. I didn't come back.
				But now I'm back. For a few reasons.</p>
				<p>I've been standing at the railing of the ferry for most of the ride, watching as we ever-
				so-slowly crawl to the island. I'm pretty sure I've been standing here for hours, but when I check my 
				phone--nope. Only been 45 minutes. My cousin Kai, and one of my favorite people in the world, is standing
				next to me, holding a bloody mary--yuck--which is his second one already. We got to the ferry dreadfully
				early this morning, thanks to my sister's annoying habit of needing to get everywhere early, so Kai had
				gotten his first bloody mary before take off. He also got me a mimosa because he said I needed to relax.
				I'm on my second one as well. Neither of us had breakfast either. And it's 9:30 a.m.</p>
				<p class="book">Clara comes to join us, standing on the other side of Kai. She was previously sitting on one of the
				benches reading, and I've been here avoiding her because she snapped at me earlier.</p>
				<p class="book">Clara nudges Kai's arm and smiles up at him. "How are you feeling about being back, Kai?" she asks him.
				Kai hasn't been back to Brayan in about a year. He used to live here with his parents, my aunt and uncle,
				who live here year round on a farm. But they got into a huge fight, and he hasn't been back since. He's been
				living on the mainland in Massachusetts, with our grandpa whose health is declining and who needs a lot of
				help these days. Ever since my grandma passed, his memory has gotten really bad.</p>
				<p class="book">Kai shrugs at her as if he doesn't care. But Clara and Kai aren't close like me and Kai are. I saw the 
				hesitation in his eyes before he shrugged. He's dreading seeing his parents.</p>
				<p class="book">"When's the last time you came home?" she prods.
				<p class="book">Kai's eyes go up and to the left. He's pretending to have to consider, but I know he hasn't been back 
				since the fight. "I'm not sure."
				<p class="book">Clara shrugs and leans over the railing. "Well anyway, I know your mom is going to be so excited to see you."
				Kai shoots me a little glare, which makes my lips tug up a little. I like the closeness that we have, that he 
				doesn't have with Clara. It makes me feel like we can speak our own little language. I like feeling close to
				other people like that. My phone buzzes in my pocket.</p>
				<p class="text">DAD: In Greece. Won't get there til July 4th.</p>
				<p class="book">I let out a long sigh of relief that seemed to be caught in my throat, and hand the phone to Kai to relay
				the message.</p>
				<p class="book">Kai gives me a tight-lipped smile and roughly gives the phone back to me. "I wish it didn't matter whether
				they're here or not," he says in a low voice. Clara looks over at us, but doesn't ask what we're talking about.</p>
				<p class="book">"But it does," I'm quick to argue.</p>
				<p class="book">"Yeah, but the longer they take to get here, the more anxious you're going to get waiting for them."</p>
				<p class="book">I cross my arms defensively. "No," even though he's right, "but anyway, there's nothing I can do about it.
				It's not my fault they're in Greece."</p>
				<p class="book">He lifts one corner of his mouth in a smile, but it doesn't reach his eyes. He lets out a breath, then hooks
				his arm around my shoulders and tugs me roughly into him. I rest my head on his shoulder. We stay like that for several moments
				and I let myself fully relax into my cousin, getting lost in the view of Brayan once again. And my head is buzzing from the alcohol
				too.</p>
				<p class="book">I vividly remember a time when I was too short to see over this railing and my dad had to hold me up so I could see
				out. I'm holding onto the same grimy railing now, and its paint is peeling in all the same places that it was twenty years ago. These 
				railings must have held so many different people's hands over the course of the ferry's lifespan. So many different 
				conversations must have been held here. That's weird to think about. I wonder how often the railings are cleaned. I awkwardly
				remove my hands and wipe them on my shorts.</p>
				<p class="book">When I was growing up, kids in my school would always throw end-of-school parties in their yards. They'd rent 
				blow-up water slides and snow cone trucks, or host sleepover parties, or have cookouts. I was always invited, but on the last
				day of school for me, I'd go home and pack my bags. I couldn't wait to get out of my hometown and go to Brayan. I'd be waiting
				all September through May for this. Brayan was where my grandparents were, and my cousins, aunt, uncle, and the Gibson's.</p>
				<p class="book">We'd come as early as my parents could get work off. My mom is a nurse and she's always had a schedule where
				she works several days on, and then a few days off in a row. She'd get a full week, or some years, ten days, off in a row for the
				beginning of summer. But then throughout the summer, she'd have to come back to the mainland to work. All summer long, she'd be going back
				and forth on the ferry. My dad is a movie director. So he'd have chunks of time off similarly to my mom. Sometimes, he'd be away filming in
				a different state, or even a different country, and then sometimes he'd be with us for months at a time, before he was taking off again.</p>
				<p class="book">During the times that both my parents were away during the summer, Clara and I would stay with the Gibson's. The Gibson's are my 
				parents closest friends. My parents only decided to buy a house on Brayan because at the same time, Walter and Wendy Gibson did. Wendy used to work 
				with my mom at the hospital. They were roommates during med school, which is how they met. Wendy and my mom were so close that they continued to live
				together in an apartment before they got married. Walter and my dad became close through their wives, but then Wendy and Walter
				got divorced. We don't see Walter anymore. And Wendy's remarried now anyway. My parents have become very close with her new husband, Jay, who owns
				a piano bar on the island. Jay's pretty set for life on the money he makes from owning one of the most popular bars on the island and a 
				sister bar on the mainland that is just as popular. So, Wendy quit the hospital and moved in with Jay. She doesn't need to work anymore.
				She's also not technically a Gibson anymore, since that was her married name, but we still call their family that. When she was married to Walter, they 
				had two boys around similar ages to me and Clara. Levi and Logan Gibson. They were our very best friends all through childhood and adulthood. And one 
				of the reasons I couldn't wait to come here every year. I loved those boys with my whole heart.</p>
				<p class="book">Things are different now. Guess we're about to find out how different.</p>
