		<p>Audra Delfino released her debut novel, Brayan Island, in 2025. She has always
		been interested in writing books, ever since elementary school when her parents
		got their first computer and put it in the living room. Audra was eight years old
		writing romance and adventure stories on Microsoft Word. She was inspired for the idea
		of Brayan Island by Block Island, which is a small island off the coast of Rhode Island.
		Block Island is somewhere Audra has frequented many times with her family. She says there
		is magic in the air on Block Island. The air is full of love and adventure. Audra says 
		that when she has gone to Block Island in the past, the characters had come to life in
		front of her and helped tell her the story of Brayan Island.</p>
		
		<p>Audra has plans to continue writing the story of Brayan Island. A side character in 
		Brayan will definitely be getting their own book. She's also always been interested in
		writing a fantasy novel or series, so hopefully that is to come in the future as well.</p>
		
		<p>Audra has been inspired by many different novels and movies for her writing. As long as
		she's been a writer, she's also been an avid reader. Audra never leaves her house without
		a book tucked into her purse, because even if she's just going to work or to a friend's house,
		her motto is, "You never know when you're going to get a chance to read, and you don't want to
		be unprepared." One of her favorite series is Magnolia Parks, by Jessa Hastings, where she feels
		she has gotten a lot of inspiration from. Other inspiration for Brayan has come from authors such
		as Carley Fortune, Jenny Han, Christina Lauren, Abby Jimenez, Taylor Jenkins Reid, as well as 
		many others.</p>
